 <h1>Tom's Favorite movies ever!</h1>
 <h2>These are the top five favorites!</h2>
 <hr />
 
 <h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
 <p>I absolutely love the story and Robin William's acting.</p>
 <h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
 <p>Love the history that is shown in the movie, plus seeing all the things Forrest does in his life.</p>
 <h3>Star Wars</h3>
 <p>Classic tale of good vs evil, plus amazing cinematography especially in the original trilogy. The films really were brought to life with a lack of CGI available at the time.</p>
 <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
 <p>Amazing story, love the fantasy world of magic that the film takes you into. I am a big fan of Allan Rickman as an actor also.</p>
 <h3>John Wick</h3>
 <p>Awesome action, and a very tragic main character</p>
